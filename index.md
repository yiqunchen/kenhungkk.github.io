# About me

I am a third year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Mathematics](http://math.berkeley.edu) at [UC Berkeley](http://www.berkeley.edu). My advisor is [Will Fithian](http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~wfithian/index.html), and I am co-advised by [David Aldous](http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~aldous/). I completed a B.S. with honors in [mathematics](http://pma.caltech.edu/content/math) with a [computer science minor](http://www.cms.caltech.edu) at [Caltech](http://www.caltech.edu). I was born in Toronto, Ontario and grew up in Hong Kong and California.

I took my qualifying exam on August 11 2016. The syllabus can be found here ([TeX](files/QualSyllabus.tex), [PDF](files/QualSyllabus.pdf)).
