\begin{enumerate}
\item At what point does the curve have maximum curvature? What happens to the curvature as $x \to \pi / 2$?
\[
y = \ln (\sec x), ~~~~ 0 \le x < \frac{\pi}{2}.
\]

\item {\em True / False?} If a curve is parametrized by its arc length, there is no tangential component of acceleration and the normal component of acceleration is the curvature.

\item {\em True / False?} The level surfaces of $f(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 - z$ are elliptic paraboloids, that can be obtained from each other by shifting in the $z$-direction.
\end{enumerate}
