\begin{enumerate}
\item Reduce the equation to one of the standard forms, classify the surface, and sketch it.
\[
x^2 - y^2 - z^2 + 2x - 6z - 8 = 0.
\]

\item {\em True / False?} Consider a space curve given by the vector equation $\rr(t)$. If all of its projections onto $xy$-plane, $yz$-plane and $xz$-plane are smooth, then the curve itself must be smooth.

\item {\em True / False?} One of the ways to visualize a space curve is to show it on a surface.
\end{enumerate}
