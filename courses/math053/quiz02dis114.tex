\begin{enumerate}
\item Find an equation of the sphere that passes through the origin and whose center is $(1, -2, 2)$.

\item {\em True / False?} Suppose $f$ and $g$ are functions of $t$, then the following two parametric curves has the same tangent line at $t = 0$:
\[
x = f(t), ~~~~ y = g(t);
\]
and
\[
x = f(-2t), ~~~~ y = g(-2t).
\]

\item {\em True / False?} Given a polar curve $r = f(\theta)$, the area under the curve and above the $x$-axis from $\theta = \alpha$ to $\theta = \beta$ is always given by
\[
\int_\alpha^\beta \frac{1}{2} f(\theta)^2 \,d\theta.
\]
\end{enumerate}
