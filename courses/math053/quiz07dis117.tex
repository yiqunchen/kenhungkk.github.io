\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the first partial derivatives of $f(x, y) = x^y$. Then use chain rule to find the derivative of $t^t$ with respect to $t$.

\item {\em True / False?} Given a function at $f$, defined on a disc near the origin. To show that $f$ is not differentiable at the origin, it suffices to find three curves through the origin, such that their tangent lines at the origin do not lie on the same plane.

\item {\em True / False?} Suppose
\[
z = f(x, y), ~~~~ x = g(t, u), ~~~~ y = h(u, v),
\]
then by chain rule we have
\[
\frac{\partial z}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial z}{\partial x} \frac{\partial x}{\partial t}.
\]
\end{enumerate}
