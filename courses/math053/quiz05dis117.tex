\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the tangential and normal components of the acceleration vector.
\[
\rr(t) = t \ii + 4e^{t/2} \jj + 2e^t \kk
\]

\item {\em True / False?} Suppose the curve $\rr(t)$ goes through the origin. A new curve formed by shrinking the curve $\rr(t)$ towards the origin by a factor of $2$. (In other words, a point $\mathbf{v}$ is shrunk to $\mathbf{v} / 2$.) The curvature is multiplied by a factor of $2$ as well.

\item {\em True / False?} For a smooth space curve $\rr(t)$ that is on the $x, y$-plane, the binormal vector (when defined) must either be $\kk$ for all $t$ or $-\kk$ for all $t$, depending on which way the curve is traversed.
\end{enumerate}
