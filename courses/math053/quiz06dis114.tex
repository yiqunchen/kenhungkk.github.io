\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the limit, if it exists, or show that the limit does not exist.
\[
\lim_{(x, y) \to (0, 0)} \frac{xy^3}{x^2 + y^6}
\]

\item {\em True / False?} If $f$ is a function whose domain contains points arbitrarily close to $(2, 3)$, then
\[
\lim_{(x, y) \to (2, 3)} f(x, y) = (2, 3).
\]

\item {\em True / False?} Consider two functions $f$ and $g$ that are both defined on the domain of $f$.  Suppose the domain of $f$, $D_f$ is contained in the domain of $g$, $D_g$ (i.e.\ $D_f$ is a subset of $D_g$) and $f(x) = g(x)$ for any points $x$ in $D_f$. If the origin is in $D_f$ and $f$ is continuous at the origin, then $g$ is also continuous at the origin.
